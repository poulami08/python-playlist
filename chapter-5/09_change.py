# Can you change the values inside a list which is contained in set S

S = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1, 2]}

S[4]=5
print(S)

# ans- first of all the question was wrong in the first place we cannot put list inside a set ad if insted of list a tuple was present then also we cannot change the values of tuple as we cannot modify the tuple.
